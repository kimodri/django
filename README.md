# üêç Study Django with Me 

This repository contains the notes and the projects from my studies about Django. The references I use and will use to study are the following:
- [Django for Beginners](https://learndjango.com/courses/django-for-beginners/)
- [Django for APIs](https://learndjango.com/courses/django-for-apis/)
- [Django for Professionals](https://learndjango.com/courses/django-for-professionals/)
- [The official documentation - DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

**Note** that these notes are catered for me specifically hence some might get confused.

I have only studied half the first book and the entire second book and I personally like the second hence it is the only (currently) directory there is although there are notes from the first book inside the `notes/`

## üèóÔ∏è Structure
Currently the repository contains:
- `django-for-apis`:
    - Library Project: Here you can see basic topics like simple configurations, simple generic view, and the typical workflow
    - To-Do Project: Here you can see how to use generic views such as `ListAPIView` and `RetrieveAPIView`, you will also see here testing, basing `CORS` and `CSRF`
    - Blogs Project: This is where it all becomes interesting as this direcotry tackles bunch of topics including:
        - custom user model
        - more 3rd party applications
        - permissions
        - authentications
        - more generic views
        - viewsets
        - more configurations 
        - deployment
- `notes`: this directory contains mixed notes from the first two books all are important to understand the first directory
- `remember`: these are markdowns containing my reminders to myself when creating a django project
- `blog_request.py`: a simple script I use to test my endpoints
